This is an app that I wrote for a CRM system. It implements such functions as: creating a waybill for Kazakh postal delivery service, adding tracks to the CRM via file or manual input. 

There are no config files and it will not work on a localhost. Published only to demonstrate the code-writing style.

Backend: https://github.com/gsi102/kazpost-be-public
